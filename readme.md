## Polymer and web components

Polymer is a framework that eases working with Web components. Web components is a new web technology that allows to split app elements into true components. Html, javascript and css can all be encapsulated, allowing for better separation of concerns. This provides the basis for a great way to build applications. Polymer provides facilities to declare web components, add functionality and connect them with data. Also provides a set of prebuilt components that may be useful.

Nevv is an app created to showcase the capabilities of Polymer. It especially shows the advantage of using web components to create advanced user interfaces. Combining css styles with javascript to provide functional styles.
